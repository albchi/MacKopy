Coding styles:

The name of the module and file name should be same. The file should 
have .v extension

The design is entirely synchronous with asynchronous reset.

The design should be compact using all the features of system verilog 3.0

Comments should be added as and when required.

Naming conventions:

All the names of signals are in lower case.
The signal name should be meaning full, need not be too long
The words can be separated by _
In the top levels, the direction to which module is important
Suppose a output going to mdule B then, the name should be o_b_xyz
and if it is inout comming from module A then, i_a_123

1. Inputs   start with i_
2. Outputs  start with o_
3. Inouts   start with io_
4. Registers      with r_
and so on 

Use of interface on top level is a must.
