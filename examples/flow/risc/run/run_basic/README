Run basic confidence test with coverage ON.
==========================================
% vcs -ntb -f ./risc8_ova.files -cm line+cond+tgl +vc ../../directc/alu.c ../../directc/decoder.c -l risc8.comp.log $*
% simv -cm line+cond+tgl -ova_report risc8.ova.log -l risc8.run.log

        Above command runs the basic confidence test with VCS which have DUT
        written in Verilog, testbench written in Native Testbench and reference
        model written in C integrated using DirectC. Please examine risc8.files
        which list all Verilog files and Native Testbench files passed to the
        VCS compiler.
% vcs -cm_pp gui -cm line+cond+tgl
        This will open a GUI to traverse through the generated coverage report.
To run the example:
	Use Makefile
