		UVM_1.1 EXAMPLES DESCRIPTION



Origin:		 Accellera 
Description:     This directory $VCS_HOME/doc/examples/uvm is collection 
		 of the examples to run basic test bench construction 
		 with UVM-1.1


Contents:	 This directory contains two directories integrated and simple.
                 Simple directory contains the basic examples demonstrating 
                 UVM_1.1 features

                 Integrated directory contains examples of complete 
                 verification components and verification environments. 
                            
                 These are all taken from the Accellera UVM-1.1 distribution. 
		 The changes  that are made are in the scripts only , and 
		 there are two additional examples provided which are  
		 the "simple/xbus_tr_record" example and the 
		 "integrated/ubus_tr_record" example. 
		 These examples helps in demonstrating the VCS UVM 
		 transaction recording with UVM_1.1


How to run the testcases:
		Though in some cases, copying the individual directory is sufficient,
		but for the following examples, additional parent directories have to be copied as well.
		The directories which have to be copied can be found from the paths provided to”+incdir” in 
		the Makefiles or compile scripts.

            In each subdirectory, there are two types of run scripts provided.
            Makefile - to run the test in make file format
            Clean.csh, comp.csh and run.csh to clean, compile and run the test separately. 
            Both of these run scripts compile and run  the same testcases.
